For Angular based application we have to used protractor. But for protractor we have to use javascript. Can we use selenium webdriver with java ? can we use selenium - java
for Angular based applications ?  --->  Answer is YES, we can do that.

There is third party API/ Liabrary we have to use  --> That is called ngWebdriver



Problems and limitations (Automationd angular applications using selenium webdriver-java):
We can automate the angular application usig Selenium webdriver using the custome Xpath eg. //input[@ng-model='first'] with proper custome wait mechanism(implict, explicit or fluent wait)
but sometimes your all above waits not working properly, and synchronization not happening properly. And we will start getting failure cases (today it is working but not working tommorow) like a typical java-webdriver.
In this situatiuon normal webdriver java synchronization won't work sometimes.
1)we may face the synchronization issue with Angular  application, if we are using webdriver java
2)we hava a different HTML/Tags and locators in Angular and we dont have any support for this in webdriver-java.



Why Angular based applications are different from other typical applications ?

* Angular Js based application used for single page application where data is very dynamic. Where the HTML content is dynamic and it is used with Angular framework.
Angular is javascript framework. 
* While trying to automate any angular application using selenium most of us face issues like synchronization and absence of angular specific locator 
like ngbinding, ngmodel, ngrepater, etc.
* In angular applications, we have different kind of content in DOM, ex. ng-bind, ng-reapeter, ng-model, ng-options. These are the different HTML tags are avilable there.  


* We are using ngWebDriver along with selenium java-webdriver.
